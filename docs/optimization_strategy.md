# Project-Specific Optimization Strategy

This document outlines the specific performance optimization strategies we will adopt for the Cyberpunk Colony Sim. These strategies are derived from the general principles found in the [Performance Optimization Guide](./performance_optimization.md) and are tailored to the unique challenges of a large-scale simulation game.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Profile First

Before implementing any optimization, we will use Godot's built-in profiler to identify the actual performance bottlenecks. Our efforts will be data-driven to avoid premature or unnecessary optimization.

## 2. Key Strategies

### 2.1. Agent & Crowd Rendering

-   **Problem:** A large number of colonists and drones will be active in the world, leading to a high number of draw calls and potential CPU overhead from animations and logic.
-   **Solution:** We will use `MultiMeshInstance3D` to render all agents (colonists, drones, etc.). This is the single most important optimization for rendering large numbers of identical or similar objects.
-   **Implementation:**
    1.  A central manager will be responsible for updating the `MultiMesh` transforms.
    2.  Individual agent logic will be decoupled from rendering. The agent's state (position, orientation) will be used to update the `MultiMesh` buffer.
    3.  Animations can be handled through custom shaders or by dynamically updating instance data.

### 2.2. Large World Management

-   **Problem:** As the colony expands, the game world will become too large to keep fully loaded in memory and process at all times.
-   **Solution:** We will implement a **world partitioning system**, commonly known as "chunking."
-   **Implementation:**
    1.  The world will be divided into a grid of fixed-size chunks.
    2.  Only chunks within a certain radius of the camera will be active (loaded and processed).
    3.  As the camera moves, chunks will be loaded/unloaded asynchronously in the background to prevent stuttering. This will likely require the use of background threads.

### 2.3. Environmental Rendering

-   **Problem:** A detailed colony with many buildings, lights, and environmental props can become a GPU bottleneck.
-   **Solution:** We will employ a combination of culling, Level of Detail (LOD), and baked lighting.
-   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Occlusion Culling:** Set up `OccluderInstance3D` nodes, especially for large, static structures, to prevent rendering objects hidden behind them.
    2.  **Visibility Ranges (Manual LOD):** Aggressively use the `visibility_range_*` properties on all environmental objects (buildings, props) to hide them when they are far from the camera.
    3.  **Baked Lighting:** For all static light sources and geometry, we will use `LightmapGI` to bake lighting. This eliminates the cost of real-time lighting calculations for the majority of the scene. Dynamic objects will use probes for lighting.

## 3. CPU Optimization

-   **Problem:** Agent AI, pathfinding, and resource management can become CPU-intensive with a large number of agents.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  **Throttled Updates:** AI and other non-critical logic for off-screen or distant agents will be updated at a lower frequency (e.g., once every 10 frames instead of every frame).
    2.  **Asynchronous Processing:** Pathfinding and other heavy calculations will be offloaded to background threads where possible to avoid blocking the main game loop.
    3.  **Efficient Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries for fast lookups, packed arrays) to manage game state efficiently.

By implementing these strategies proactively, we can build a scalable foundation that will support our vision for a complex, large-scale colony simulation.
