# AI Behavior Systems Research: FSMs vs. Behavior Trees

This document summarizes the research on two popular AI behavior systems for game development: Finite State Machines (FSMs) and Behavior Trees (BTs).

## 1. Finite State Machines (FSMs)

### Concept
A Finite State Machine is a model of computation based on a hypothetical machine that can be in only one of a finite number of "states" at any given time. The machine can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a "transition."

An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. For example, an enemy AI might have states like `IDLE`, `PATROL`, `CHASE`, and `ATTACK`. Transitions are triggered by events, such as the player entering the enemy's line of sight.

### Application
FSMs are well-suited for:
- Simple AI with a limited number of well-defined behaviors.
- Scenarios where logic is rigid and does not require a high degree of reactivity.
- UI flow management (e.g., menu navigation).
- Simple character controllers.

### Advantages
- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement for small-scale problems.
- **Efficiency:** Very low performance overhead.
- **Predictability:** The behavior of an FSM is straightforward and easy to trace as long as the number of states is low.

### Disadvantages
- **Scalability:** FSMs become exponentially more complex as new states and transitions are added. This can lead to a tangled web of connections often called "state machine spaghetti," which is difficult to debug and maintain.
- **Modularity:** It is difficult to reuse or rearrange states. A state is tightly coupled with its specific transitions.
- **Reactivity:** Implementing reactive behavior often requires adding transitions from every state to every other state, which clutters the design.
- **Parallelism:** FSMs are inherently sequential and cannot easily represent parallel behaviors (e.g., attacking while moving).

## 2. Behavior Trees (BTs)

### Concept
A Behavior Tree is a hierarchical model for organizing AI tasks. It is a tree of nodes where leaf nodes represent actions or conditions, and internal nodes (composites) control the flow of execution. The tree is evaluated from the root down to the leaves on each "tick" or frame.

Common node types include:
- **Sequence:** Executes its children in order until one fails.
- **Selector (or Fallback):** Executes its children in order until one succeeds.
- **Parallel:** Executes all its children simultaneously.
- **Action:** Performs a task, like moving or attacking.
- **Condition:** Checks a condition in the game world, like "Is player in range?".

### Application
Behavior Trees are ideal for:
- Complex AI with many possible actions and decisions.
- Agents that need to react to a dynamic environment in a sophisticated way.
- Creating layered and modular behaviors that can be easily combined and extended.
- Simulating intelligent agents in strategy or simulation games.

### Advantages
- **Modularity & Scalability:** BTs are highly modular. Entire branches of behavior can be created, tested, and then easily added to or rearranged within a larger tree. This makes them extremely scalable.
- **Reactivity:** Their hierarchical and ticking nature makes BTs inherently reactive. High-priority behaviors (like dodging an attack) can be placed at the top of the tree to interrupt lower-priority tasks.
- **Readability:** A visual representation of a BT is often much easier to understand than a complex FSM diagram. The flow of logic is explicit.
- **Reusability:** Individual tasks and entire sub-trees can be reused across different AI agents.

### Disadvantages
- **Initial Complexity:** The initial setup for a BT system can be more complex than a simple FSM.
- **Overhead:** There can be a slightly higher performance cost due to the tree traversal on each tick, though this is generally well-optimized in modern implementations.
- **Overkill for Simple AI:** For an entity that only has two or three states, a Behavior Tree might be an unnecessarily complex solution.

## 3. Recommendation

For the "Cyberpunk Colony Sim" project, the AI requirements will likely involve colonists making complex, multi-step decisions based on their needs, the environment, and their assigned jobs. This suggests a need for a highly scalable and modular AI system.

**Recommendation: Use Behavior Trees.**

While FSMs are simpler to start with, they will quickly become a bottleneck as the simulation's complexity grows. Behavior Trees provide the flexibility needed to manage the emergent behaviors of colonists in a dynamic simulation. Their modularity will allow for the clean separation of concerns (e.g., a "Find Food" subtree, a "Perform Job" subtree) and make the overall AI architecture much easier to maintain and expand in the long term. This aligns with the memory guideline that recommends BTs for complex agent AI.
