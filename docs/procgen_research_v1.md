## 1. Objective

This document outlines recommended techniques and a proposed software stack for generating a large-scale, procedurally generated cyberpunk megacity in Godot 4.5.1. The goal is to create a believable urban environment with distinct districts, road networks, and building interiors.

## 2. Recommended High-Level Techniques

Based on an analysis of existing procedural generation projects and common practices, a hybrid approach is recommended. This approach combines several techniques to leverage their individual strengths.

### 2.1. City Layout and Road Networks

**Primary Technique: L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)**

*   **Description:** An L-System is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. It consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.
*   **Application:** We can define simple rules for road segments: "go straight," "branch left," "branch right," "form an intersection." By starting with a single road segment (the axiom) and applying these rules iteratively, we can generate complex and organic road networks.
*   **Example:** The `citygen-godot` project uses a priority queue to extend road segments one by one, which is a practical implementation of an L-System.

**Secondary Technique: Population/Density Maps**

*   **Description:** Use noise algorithms (like **Perlin Noise** or **OpenSimplexNoise**) to generate a "heatmap" of the city. Different values in the map can represent different district types (e.g., high values for a dense downtown, mid-values for commercial, low values for industrial).
*   **Application:** This map will influence the L-System rules. For example:
    *   In high-density areas, increase the probability of branching to create a dense grid.
    *   In low-density areas, prefer longer, straighter roads (highways).
    *   Use the map to determine building density and height.

### 2.2. Building Generation

**Exterior Generation:**

*   Buildings should be generated along road segments. Their position and rotation should be aligned with the road they are attached to.
*   The dimensions (width, depth, height) can be influenced by the population map. Taller skyscrapers should appear in the "downtown" areas.

**Interior Generation:**

*   For the interiors of buildings, especially our starting warehouse, we can use **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** or a simple **Grid-Based Cellular Automata** approach.
*   **WFC:** Define a set of modular room tiles (e.g., "corridor," "small room," "large room," "wall section") and the rules for how they can connect. WFC can then generate complex and non-repetitive layouts from these rules. This is ideal for the intricate and semi-random layouts we want.
*   **Cellular Automata:** A simpler method where we start with a grid of random cells (e.g., "floor" or "wall") and apply rules over several iterations to "grow" rooms and corridors. This is less complex to implement than WFC and may be a good starting point.

## 3. Recommended Godot Stack & Implementation

### 3.1. Core Logic

*   The entire generation process should be written in **GDScript** for seamless integration with the Godot API. We should leverage Godot 4's static typing for performance and code clarity.
*   The generation should be encapsulated in a single `CityGenerator` node that can be controlled from the main scene.

### 3.2. Key Godot APIs to Use

*   **`RandomNumberGenerator`:** Use this class for all random number generation to ensure reproducibility by setting a seed. Avoid using global `randi()`/`randf()`.
*   **`Noise` resources:** Godot provides `FastNoiseLite` (which can be configured for Perlin, Simplex, etc.) directly in the editor. We can use this for our population/density maps.
*   **`Physics2DShapeQueryParameters` / `Physics3DShapeQueryParameters`:** As seen in the `citygen-godot` example, using the physics engine for spatial queries (e.g., "find all roads within this radius," "is this building location occupied?") is highly efficient and recommended over manual checks.
*   **`TileMap` / `GridMap`:** For generating building interiors, `TileMap` (for 2D) or `GridMap` (for 3D) are the ideal nodes to use. The generation algorithm (WFC or Cellular Automata) will programmatically set the tiles in the map.

### 3.3. Existing Libraries/Plugins

*   **Initial Recommendation:** At this stage, it is recommended to **implement the core logic ourselves** rather than relying on an external library.
*   **Rationale:**
    1.  **Customization:** Our needs are specific, and building our own system gives us full control.
    2.  **Learning:** Implementing these algorithms will give the programming team a deep understanding of the game's core systems.
    3.  **Godot 4 Compatibility:** Many existing proc-gen libraries are for Godot 3 and may require significant work to port.
*   The `citygen-godot` repository should be used as a primary **learning resource and reference**, but not as a direct dependency.

## 4. Next Steps (for the Programming Team)

1.  Create a new `CityGenerator` node and script in the `src/world_generation/` directory.
2.  Implement a basic L-System for road generation, using the `citygen-godot` script as a guide.
3.  Use `FastNoiseLite` to create a population map that influences road branching probability.
4.  Render the generated roads using simple `Line2D` nodes for visualization.
