# Performance Optimization for Large-Scale Simulations in Godot

This document outlines key performance optimization techniques relevant to the "Cyberpunk Colony Sim" project. The focus is on strategies for managing large-scale simulations, which are critical for the game's core mechanics.

## 1. Multithreading

*   **Concept:** Multithreading involves executing multiple threads (sequences of instructions) concurrently. In Godot, this can be used to offload computationally expensive tasks from the main thread, preventing the game from freezing or stuttering.

*   **Application:**
    *   **Procedural Generation:** Running algorithms for city and interior generation on a separate thread to avoid hitches during gameplay.
    *   **Agent AI:** Processing the logic for a large number of agents (colonists) in parallel.
    *   **Pathfinding:** Calculating paths for agents without blocking the main game loop.
    *   Godot 4 provides a `Thread` class and worker pools to manage multithreaded tasks.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Improved responsiveness and smoother frame rates.
    *   Better utilization of modern multi-core CPUs.
    *   Enables more complex and larger-scale simulations.

*   **Recommendation:** Aggressively use multithreading for all heavy computations. A dedicated thread pool for agent AI and another for procedural generation tasks would be a good starting point.

## 2. Visual Optimization

### a. Occlusion Culling

*   **Concept:** Occlusion culling is a technique that prevents the rendering of objects that are hidden from the camera's view by other objects (occluders).

*   **Application:**
    *   In a dense city environment, many buildings and objects will be obscured by others. Occlusion culling can significantly reduce the number of objects the GPU needs to render.
    *   Godot 4 has a built-in Occlusion Culling system that can be set up in the editor.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Reduces GPU load, leading to higher frame rates.
    *   Particularly effective in scenes with high object density.

*   **Recommendation:** Implement occlusion culling for the main city scene. Designate large, static objects like buildings as occluders.

### b. Level of Detail (LOD)

*   **Concept:** Level of Detail involves using multiple versions of a model with varying levels of complexity. The engine swaps these models based on the object's distance from the cameraâ€”simpler models are used for distant objects.

*   **Application:**
    *   High-poly models for buildings and vehicles when they are close to the camera.
    *   Low-poly versions of the same assets when they are far away.
    *   Godot provides an `LOD` node to manage this process automatically.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Reduces the number of polygons the GPU needs to process for distant objects.
    *   Improves rendering performance in large, open scenes.

*   **Recommendation:** Create LODs for all complex 3D assets, especially buildings and vehicles. A 2-3 level LOD chain should be sufficient.

### c. MultiMesh for Instancing

*   **Concept:** A `MultiMesh` is a single resource that can be used to draw thousands of instances of a mesh with minimal performance cost. It's highly efficient for rendering large numbers of identical or similar objects.

*   **Application:**
    *   Rendering repeating environmental details like streetlights, trees, or debris.
    *   Drawing large crowds of simple, non-interactive agents.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Drastically reduces draw calls, which is a common bottleneck.
    *   Very low CPU overhead for managing instances.

*   **Recommendation:** Use `MultiMeshInstance3D` for any repeating, static geometry in the city.

## 3. Efficient Resource Loading

*   **Concept:** Loading large assets (like scenes or textures) on the main thread can cause the game to freeze. Threaded loading allows these assets to be loaded in the background without interrupting the game.

*   **Application:**
    *   Loading new city blocks or building interiors as the player moves through the world.
    *   Pre-loading assets for upcoming events or areas.
    *   Godot's `ResourceManager` (or a custom equivalent) can be used to manage background loading requests.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Eliminates loading screens and stuttering during gameplay.
    *   Creates a more seamless and immersive experience.

*   **Recommendation:** Implement a system for asynchronous loading of all major assets. This is crucial for an open-world or large-scale simulation game.
