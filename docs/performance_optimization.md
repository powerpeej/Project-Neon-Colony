# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines various techniques for optimizing performance in the "Cyberpunk Colony Sim" project, based on research into Godot Engine's capabilities. These strategies are categorized into CPU, GPU, and Memory/General optimizations to help the team identify and apply the most relevant techniques for their tasks.

## CPU Optimization

CPU bottlenecks often manifest as stuttering or low frame rates, especially in scenes with complex logic or a high number of nodes.

### Multithreading

For tasks that involve heavy computation but don't need to be executed in lockstep with the main game loop (e.g., AI pathfinding, procedural generation), use multithreading to prevent them from blocking the main thread.

- **Godot's `Thread` class:** Provides a straightforward way to create and manage threads.
- **Thread-Safe APIs:** Use `Mutex` to protect data from simultaneous access and `Semaphore` to control thread execution flow.
- **Recommendation:** Offload complex agent behavior calculations or large-scale simulation updates to separate threads.

### Using Servers Directly

For scenarios with thousands of similar objects (e.g., bullets, debris, simple decorative elements), bypassing the SceneTree and interacting directly with the servers can provide a massive performance boost.

- **Servers:** `RenderingServer` (for visuals), `PhysicsServer2D`, and `PhysicsServer3D`.
- **How it works:** You create and manipulate objects using their Resource IDs (`RID`) directly, which has significantly less overhead than managing full nodes.
- **Recommendation:** Use this for particle-like systems or any scenario where a very large number of simple, repeated objects is required.

### Code Profiling and Language Choice

- **Identify Bottlenecks:** Before optimizing, use Godot's built-in profiler to identify which functions are taking the most CPU time.
- **Language Choice:** While GDScript is highly optimized, performance-critical algorithms may benefit from being implemented in C# or C++ via GDExtension for maximum speed.

## GPU Optimization

GPU bottlenecks occur when the graphics card is overwhelmed with rendering tasks. This is common in visually complex scenes with high-resolution graphics, complex lighting, and a large number of objects.

### Culling Techniques

Culling prevents the engine from drawing objects that are not visible to the camera, reducing the GPU's workload.

- **Occlusion Culling:** Prevents rendering of objects that are completely hidden behind other opaque objects. This is extremely useful for dense city environments.
- **Visibility Ranges (HLOD):** Hides nodes when they are beyond a certain distance from the camera. This is a simple but effective form of Level of Detail.

### Batching and Instancing

Drawing many individual objects can be slow. Batching combines multiple objects into a single draw call.

- **MultiMeshInstance3D:** The most powerful tool for this. It allows you to draw thousands of instances of a single mesh with unique transformations (position, rotation, color) in one go. Ideal for forests, crowds, or fields of debris.
- **Automatic Batching:** Godot's renderer can automatically batch draw calls for objects with the same material. This can be enabled in the project settings.

### Level of Detail (LOD)

LOD uses simpler, lower-polygon models for objects when they are far away from the camera.

- **Mesh LOD:** Godot can automatically generate lower-detail versions of your meshes and switch between them based on distance.
- **Manual LOD:** You can create your own LOD system by swapping scenes or nodes at different distances.

### Shader Optimization

Complex shaders are a common source of GPU bottlenecks.

- **Keep it Simple:** The more instructions in a shader, the slower it runs.
- **Profile:** Use the shader profiler to analyze the performance of your shaders.
- **Fragment vs. Vertex:** Operations in the fragment (pixel) shader are more expensive than in the vertex shader, as they run for every pixel on the screen.

## Memory and General Optimization

These are general best practices that impact both performance and loading times.

### Asset Optimization

- **Texture Compression:** Use VRAM compression for textures to reduce memory usage and improve rendering performance.
- **Texture Sizing:** Use appropriately sized textures. A 4K texture on a tiny object is a waste of resources.
- **Mesh Optimization:** Keep polygon counts reasonable, especially for objects that will be instanced many times.

### Physics Optimization

- **Simple Shapes:** Use simple collision shapes (like spheres, boxes, and capsules) whenever possible.
- **Avoid Trimesh:** `ConcavePolygonShape` (or Trimesh) colliders are the most expensive and should be used sparingly, primarily for static level geometry.
- **Static vs. Rigid:** Use `StaticBody` for non-moving objects.

### Using Profilers

**Do not optimize blindly.** Godot provides a suite of powerful profiling tools.

- **Debugger Profiler:** Identifies slow functions and scripts.
- **Visual Profiler:** Provides a frame-by-frame breakdown of what the engine is doing.
- **GPU Profiler:** Shows detailed information about rendering costs.

Use these tools to find the actual bottlenecks in your game before attempting to apply optimizations.
