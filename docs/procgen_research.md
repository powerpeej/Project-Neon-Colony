# Procedural Generation Research Summary

This document summarizes the initial research findings for procedural generation techniques to be used in the Cyberpunk Colony Sim project.

## 1. L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems) for Road Networks

**Concept:**
L-Systems are a formal grammar used to model the growth processes of plants, but they are also highly effective for generating fractal-like patterns, such as road networks. An L-System is defined by an alphabet, a set of production rules, and an initial string (axiom).

**Application for City Generation:**
We can use L-Systems to generate the primary road network of our city.

*   **Axiom:** A starting string, e.g., "F" (representing a single road segment).
*   **Rules:** Rules that replace characters in the string, e.g., `F -> F+F-F-F+F`. The symbols `+` and `-` can represent turning left or right, and `[` and `]` can represent branching paths.
*   **Interpretation:** A "turtle" graphics system can interpret the final string to draw the road map.

**Advantages:**
*   Can create organic and complex road layouts.
*   Highly controllable through the definition of rules.
*   Can be combined with noise maps (e.g., Perlin noise) to influence road density based on a simulated population map.

**Recommendation:**
Use L-Systems as the foundational layer for our city map to create the main arterial roads.

## 2. Wave Function Collapse (WFC) for Building Placement

**Concept:**
WFC is an algorithm that produces a bitmap from a small input bitmap by arranging tiles based on adjacency constraints. It ensures that the generated output is locally similar to the input.

**Application for City Generation:**
Once we have a road network, we can use WFC to fill in the city blocks with buildings and other details.

*   **Input:** A small set of "tile" patterns representing different building types, empty lots, parks, etc.
*   **Constraints:** Define how these tiles can be placed next to each other (e.g., a skyscraper tile can't be next to a park tile).
*   **Process:** The algorithm iteratively "collapses" the possibilities for each grid cell until a complete, valid map is formed.

**Advantages:**
*   Generates highly detailed and locally consistent environments.
*   Excellent for creating dense, urban environments with a "designed" feel.
*   Can be constrained by the previously generated road network.

**Recommendation:**
Use WFC to populate the areas between the roads generated by the L-System. This will allow for detailed and varied city blocks.

## Conclusion

A hybrid approach is recommended:

1.  **Generate a population density map** using a noise function.
2.  **Use an L-System** influenced by the population map to generate the main road network.
3.  **Use Wave Function Collapse** to fill in the city blocks with buildings, props, and other details.

This combination will provide a robust and flexible system for creating diverse and believable cyberpunk cityscapes.
