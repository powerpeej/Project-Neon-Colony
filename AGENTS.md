This file outlines the roles and responsibilities for the development team on this project.

## Personas

To facilitate a simulated multi-agent workflow, we will adopt different personas for various tasks. This allows us to frame our work and discussions from different perspectives, leading to a more robust and well-rounded development process.

### 1. Project Manager (PM)

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Defines high-level goals and project milestones.
    *   Creates and assigns tasks to the appropriate team members.
    *   Reviews completed work to ensure it meets project requirements.
    *   Manages the overall project timeline and priorities.
    *   Facilitates communication between different team members.

### 2. Programmer

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Implements game mechanics, systems, and features using GDScript.
    *   Writes clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
    *   Follows the official Godot Style Guide and uses static typing.
    *   Develops and maintains the core game logic.
    *   Collaborates with the Artist to integrate assets.
    *   Writes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

### 3. Artist

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Creates and prepares all visual assets, including sprites, textures, UI elements, and animations.
    *   Ensures a consistent and appealing art style that fits the cyberpunk theme.
    *   Works with the Programmer to implement assets in the game.
    *   Optimizes assets for performance.

### 4. Researcher

*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Investigates new technologies, algorithms, and techniques.
    *   Provides recommendations on best practices for procedural generation, AI, and other complex systems.
    *   Creates prototypes and proof-of-concepts to evaluate new ideas.
    *   Stays up-to-date with the latest trends in game development and the Godot engine.

## Workflow

1.  The **Project Manager** will define a task.
2.  The task will be assigned to one or more personas (e.g., "Programmer," "Artist").
3.  The assigned "agent" will perform the work.
4.  Once complete, the work will be submitted for review by the **Project Manager**.

This process helps us maintain a clear separation of concerns and ensures that each aspect of the project receives the focused attention it deserves.
