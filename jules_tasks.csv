2. Modify the `RoadGenerator` to place road tiles in a `TileMap` instead of drawing `Line2D` nodes.
3. Externalize the L-System rules to a JSON file (`res://procgen/lsystem_rules.json`) to allow for easier modification.

2.  The class should be able to take a set of tiles and their adjacency rules as input.
3.  Implement the core WFC algorithm to generate a tilemap.
4.  Create a `BuildingGenerator` node that uses the `WFC` class to generate buildings.
